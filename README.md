# Python-Projects
A personal repository for my python programming projects.
These codes/Apps are written or developed by me to help improve my programming (python) capabilities.
This repository shows worked examples i have done from "https://www.py4e.com/lessons", and personal project(tax calculators for Canada). Being prolific in python programming, which is a scripting language has helped my terminal, command prompts, metasploit, and shell usage.
